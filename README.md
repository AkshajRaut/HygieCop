# HygieCop
We all are aware about the health risks led by COVID-19 in our country. And point to which the Government and the other health agencies are focusing upon is Hygiene. So our team is designing HygieCop- Smart Sanitizer Dispenser especially meant for the police force for our country who are day and night ensuring obeyance of lockdown and other security tasks. This we are going to achieve using Blynk- IoT. The ID and Passwords to access this system shall be given to the respective police force ONLY. The app shall send a notification to the team of policemen deployed in a area after every half and hour on the app to sanitize their hands. They need to approach the HygieCop- Smart Sanitizer Dispenser made by us. The UltraSonic sensor used in the container storing the Hand Rub, shall detect the presence of the cop and allow the motor to run for 2 seconds once the cop approaches the kiosk. This shall prevent the wastage of the sanitizer used. There would also be a Probe in the container which shall detect the amount of hand rub left in the container. It shall notify on the app once the container gets empty. Now the PSI shall ensure that this container is refilled at regular intervals once empty. This shall prevent transmission of this deadly virus into the police force. We really hope that this idea shall help to protect this major group of people working in India under emergency services.
